jsFITS
======

FITS (http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_primer.html) is the Flexible Image Transport System and is widely used in astronomy for holding observation data. There are many FITS I/O libraries available in a variety of languages (http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_libraries.html). This is an attempt to build a FITS library for Javascript to allow FITS files to be displayed in a modern web browser. Given that FITS files have no compression they are quite large so I imagine this library will be more useful when run locally. By displaying the image using <canvas> in the browser, it will be very easy to save a FITS image as a standard graphics file.

Dependencies
------------

For this library to work it has a few dependencies:

* binaryajax.js(http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/binaryajax/binaryajax.js) -- this does the XMLHttpRequest and the bit extraction. It is created by Jacob Seidelin and is only about 6.2 kB.
* excanvas.js(http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/) -- this is used to allow canvas support on Internet Explorer.

Limitations
-----------
Due to web browser cross-domain security issues, any FITS file you want to read must be hosted on the same domain as the code.

FITS files
----------
Some example FITS files (from the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network - http://lcogt.net/) can be found at:
* M51 http://ari-archive.lcogt.net/data/webfiles/1298221795/l_e_20110215_205_1_1_1.fits (taken with Faulkes Telescope North operated by LCOGT)
* M108 http://ari-archive.lcogt.net/data/webfiles/1298260631/l_e_20110215_203_1_1_1.fits (taken with Faulkes Telescope North operated by LCOGT)
* WFPC II 800 x 800 x 4 primary array data cube containing the 4 CCD images http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/browse?file=/samples/WFPC2u5780205r_c0fx.fits (trimmed to 200 x 200 taken from http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_samples.html)
